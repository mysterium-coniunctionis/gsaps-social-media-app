# Documentation Archive

This directory contains historical documentation and detailed reports that have been archived to keep the root directory clean and focused on current, actively-maintained documentation.

## Purpose

## When to Use Archive Documents

Archive documents are useful for:
- Understanding historical context and decisions
- Reviewing detailed test results from specific periods
- Learning about the evolution of features
- Reference for similar future work
- Audit trails and documentation history

## Active Documentation

For current, actively-maintained documentation, see:
- [/README.md](/README.md) - Project overview
- [/DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md](/DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md) - Complete documentation index
- [/PROJECT_STATUS.md](/PROJECT_STATUS.md) - Current status and roadmap
- [/QUALITY_ASSURANCE.md](/QUALITY_ASSURANCE.md) - Consolidated QA documentation

## Archive Maintenance

Archives are:
- **Preserved but not updated** - Content frozen at archive date
- **Referenced from main docs** - Links point to archive when needed
- **Organized by category** - Structured for easy navigation
- **Versioned** - Part of git history for full traceability

## Questions?

1. Check the [DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md](/DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md) for current equivalents
2. Review the git commit history for archival context
3. Open a GitHub issue for clarification
