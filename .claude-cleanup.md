# Project Cleanup Configuration
# Place this file in your project root and reference it with Claude Code

## Project Info
- **Name**: gsaps-social-media-app
- **Type**: Social Media Application
- **Stack**: [e.g., React, Node.js, MongoDB, etc.]

## Cleanup Rules

### Safe to Remove Categories
- Unused npm dependencies
- Commented-out code blocks
- Unused imports
- `.env.example` duplicates
- Old migration files (after verification)
- Unused test fixtures
- Build artifacts (dist/, build/)
- Temporary files (.DS_Store, Thumbs.db)

### Folders to Exclude from Cleanup
- node_modules/
- .git/
- dist/ (if needed for deployment)
- public/assets/ (if actively used)

### Files to Preserve
- README.md
- LICENSE
- .gitignore
- .env.example (template)
- package.json
- Configuration files (webpack, babel, etc.)

### Special Considerations
- Check for unused routes in routing files
- Review API endpoints for deprecated versions
- Look for unused database models/schemas
- Identify orphaned component files
- Check for unused Redux actions/reducers (if applicable)
- Review unused CSS/SCSS files
- Check for duplicate utility functions

## Cleanup Process

### Phase 1: Analysis (No Changes)
1. Scan project structure
2. Identify unused dependencies
3. Find dead code
4. List unused files
5. Generate detailed report with file sizes

### Phase 2: Low-Risk Cleanup (Safe to automate)
1. Remove unused dependencies from package.json
2. Delete commented-out code
3. Remove unused imports
4. Clean up console.logs and debug statements
5. Remove empty files

### Phase 3: Medium-Risk Cleanup (Needs verification)
1. Remove unused components
2. Delete orphaned files
3. Clean up unused utility functions
4. Remove duplicate code

### Phase 4: High-Risk Cleanup (Manual review required)
1. Remove potentially unused routes
2. Delete old API versions
3. Remove database migrations
4. Clean up unused environment variables

## Testing Requirements
After each phase:
- Run `npm test` (or test command)
- Verify build: `npm run build`
- Check linting: `npm run lint`
- Manual smoke test of key features

## Reporting Format
Generate report with:
- Files by size (largest first)
- Dependencies by last usage date
- Code complexity metrics
- Estimated cleanup impact (MB saved)

## Safety Checklist
- [ ] Create new git branch: `git checkout -b cleanup-[date]`
- [ ] Commit before starting: `git commit -m "Pre-cleanup checkpoint"`
- [ ] Run tests before cleanup
- [ ] Run tests after each phase
- [ ] Keep cleanup report for documentation
