## 💡 KEY INSIGHTS

### The Opportunity
GSAPS has built an excellent **academic social platform** (95% feature parity).

**But:** Features are generic—similar to Facebook, LinkedIn, Moodle.

**Gap:** Missing psychedelic-specific functionality despite target audience.

**Solution:** Build 10 killer features that address real unmet needs.

### Why This Matters

**The psychedelic renaissance is happening NOW:**
- MDMA therapy likely FDA-approved 2024-2025
- Psilocybin therapy expanding (Oregon, Colorado, Australia)
- Billions in investment flowing in

**But professional infrastructure doesn't exist yet.**

**GSAPS can be that infrastructure.**

### Business Model

**Professional Tier ($29/mo):**
- Case consultation access
- Advanced career tools
- Premium therapist listing
- Research collaboration

**Institutional Tier ($299/mo):**
- Multi-user licenses for clinics
- Custom integration circles
- White-label patient prep
- Research hub

**Revenue Potential:** $300K+ Year 1

---

## 🎓 LESSONS LEARNED

1. **Focus is key** - 10 features, 3 immediate priorities, clear roadmap
2. **Real needs matter** - Features based on actual community needs, not trends
3. **Safety first** - Trauma-informed, crisis resources, cultural humility
4. **Start small** - MVP approach, iterate based on feedback
5. **Documentation critical** - Comprehensive notes enable seamless handoff

---

## ✨ NEXT SESSION PREVIEW

**First Task:** Build matching algorithm in `src/utils/circleMatching.js`

**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours for matching algorithm + wizard

**You'll have:** Complete code examples, data models, and implementation guidance
