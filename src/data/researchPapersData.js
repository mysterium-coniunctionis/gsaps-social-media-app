    abstract: 'Background: Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) affects millions worldwide with limited therapeutic options. This study investigates the long-term efficacy and safety of psilocybin-assisted therapy for TRD. Methods: Nineteen patients with TRD received two doses of psilocybin (10 mg and 25 mg, 7 days apart) with psychological support. Results: At 6-month follow-up, significant reductions in depressive symptoms were maintained, with 58% of participants showing clinical response. Conclusions: Psilocybin therapy shows promise for sustained antidepressant effects in treatment-resistant populations.',

Using behavioral, pharmacological, and optogenetic approaches in mice, we demonstrate that LSD promotes social behavior through activation of 5-HT2A receptors in the medial prefrontal cortex and dopamine D2 receptors in the nucleus accumbens. These findings suggest that LSD may have therapeutic potential for disorders characterized by social dysfunction, including autism spectrum disorder and social anxiety.',

We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial examining the effects of microdoses of LSD (10 μg) on mood, cognition, and creativity. Participants completed assessments over four weeks. Results showed modest improvements in certain cognitive tasks but no significant effects on mood or well-being compared to placebo.

    abstract: 'Psychedelics have emerged as promising therapeutics for neuropsychiatric disorders, with effects that persist long after the acute drug experience. Here, we investigate the molecular mechanisms by which psychedelics promote neural plasticity and synaptogenesis. Using in vitro and in vivo models, we demonstrate that psychedelics activate TrkB, AMPA, and mGluR signaling pathways, leading to increased dendritic spine density and synaptic plasticity. These neuroplastic changes may underlie the sustained therapeutic effects observed clinically. Our findings suggest that psychoplastogenic compounds represent a novel class of fast-acting antidepressants.',

    abstract: 'Depression, anxiety, and related disorders are associated with atrophy of neurons in the prefrontal cortex. We demonstrate that psychedelics, including LSD and psilocybin, robustly promote neuritogenesis and spinogenesis both in vitro and in vivo. These structural changes are mediated through activation of 5-HT2A receptors and downstream signaling through BDNF-TrkB pathways. Remarkably, these effects occur at sub-hallucinogenic doses and persist for extended periods, suggesting that the psychoplastogenic properties of psychedelics may be separable from their subjective effects.',

Method: Meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials comparing ketamine to control conditions. Results: Analysis of 17 trials (n=897) showed significant benefit for ketamine (standardized mean difference = -0.88). Effects emerged within 24 hours and persisted for at least 7 days. Adverse effects were generally transient. Conclusions: Ketamine demonstrates robust rapid-acting antidepressant effects in TRD.',

    abstract: 'Ketamine produces rapid and sustained antidepressant effects through mechanisms distinct from traditional antidepressants. This review examines the neural mechanisms underlying ketamine\'s therapeutic actions, including NMDA receptor blockade, AMPA receptor potentiation, and activation of mTOR signaling. We discuss how these molecular events lead to increased synaptic plasticity and reversal of stress-induced neuronal deficits. Understanding these mechanisms may enable development of next-generation rapid-acting antidepressants with improved safety profiles.',

We conducted a double-blind study comparing psilocybin (30 mg/70 kg) with methylphenidate in 36 hallucinogen-naive volunteers. Participants received psilocybin and methylphenidate in counterbalanced order with 8 hours of preparation and supervision. At 2 months, 67% of psilocybin sessions met criteria for "complete" mystical experience compared to 0% of methylphenidate sessions. Ratings of personal meaning and spiritual significance were extremely high and remained high at 14-month follow-up. These findings document psilocybin\'s capacity to reliably occasion mystical experiences with lasting positive effects.',
